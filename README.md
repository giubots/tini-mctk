# TINI - MCTK

This is a Vue component that adds a multi-modal troubleshooting conversational agent, suitable for small applications.
It is easy to configure and supports multiple languages.

This is still WIP! Missing steps include exporting to NPM, optimizing NLP usage, and documentation.
Find more information in the published paper: (SOON!).

This builds on [vue-beautiful-chat](https://github.com/mattmezza/vue-beautiful-chat) for the chat panel and [NLP.js](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js/) for intent extraction and language recognition. 
The example uses [TUI Image Editor](https://github.com/nhn/tui.image-editor).
